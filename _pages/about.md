Hello there, I am currently a C&O MMath student at University of Waterloo under
supervision of Levent Tuncel. Prior to this I also did my undergraduate at
Waterloo studying CS and C&O, worked with George Labahn and Arne Storjohann on randomized
algorithm computing matrix canonical form. I am extremely interested in
algorithmic design, mathematics, and programming.
